# VRHouseTour
 prototype asymmetric networked VR app using photon fusion where one pc user tours a meta quest VR around a house from a console menu

built this over a lazy sunday as a prototype for an idea i've been kicking around, could definitely be improved, may or may not do so if i get around to it

to use:

you will need to download the executable or apk from the release, and a vr device.

1. one user on the pc should start up the unity app and select to be a host

2. only once someone has started hosting the app on pc, then you can start the app on a VR headset, should connect automatically 

the hosting pc user can press buttons on the bottom of their screen to teleport the VR users around the house

in theory you should also be able to host and navigate VR user through a android phone or tablet, just havent tested that yet
