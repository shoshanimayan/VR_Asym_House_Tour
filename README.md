# VRHouseTour
 prototype asymmetric networked VR app using photon fusion where one pc user tours a VR user around a house from a console menu

built this over a lazy sunday as a prototype for an idea i've been kicking around, could definitely be improved, may or may not do so if i get around to it

to use:
1. one user on the pc should start up the unity app and select to be a host

2. only once someone has started hosting the app on pc, then you can start the app on a VR headset, should connect automatically 

the hosting pc user can press buttons on the bottom of their screen to teleport the VR users around the house
